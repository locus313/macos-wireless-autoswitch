## Usage

To use any of these chat modes in GitHub Copilot:

1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code
2. Reference the chat mode by using `@chatmode` followed by the filename (without extension)
3. Example: `@chatmode janitor` to use the Universal Janitor

## Project Context

These chat modes are particularly valuable for this macOS wireless autoswitch project because they provide:

- **Shell script optimization** (Universal Janitor, Code Alchemist)
- **System debugging assistance** (Debug Mode, Beast Mode)
- **Project structure improvements** (Blueprint Mode, Principal Engineer)
